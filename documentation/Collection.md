# Collection
 
 Collection is a special resource made to hold a group of values. Think about it like a fancy array in an object form.

We use this specialized class to manipulate their content and know when an action was performed in the object and we don't intent to expose a direct use for this class in the plugin.

## Collection structure

Collection aims to be the equivalent of an array of arrays, being an array of collections, a collection of collections, with some structural functions added to it to create a tree-like structure.

Most (if not all) methods that array used are implemented on this class, and are just a reflection of what those functions does.
